Credit Card Fraud Detection 🚀
🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning. The dataset is highly imbalanced, so techniques like SMOTE and Precision-Recall Optimization were applied to improve fraud detection.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction data with:

Time & Amount features

V1 to V28 (PCA-transformed features)

Class (0 = Not Fraud, 1 = Fraud)

🛠️ Techniques Used
✅ Data Preprocessing (Handling Imbalance with SMOTE)
✅ Feature Engineering & Scaling
✅ Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
✅ Evaluation (Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC, F1-score)

📊 Results
🏆 Training Accuracy: 95.17%
📉 Test Accuracy: 90.86%
